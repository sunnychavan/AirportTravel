      <h2>The geographic study of flight volume by route.</h2>
      <p>
        In an effort to better understand the distribution of flights throughout
        the United States, we plotted the routes of 2.7 million flights on a
        map, denoting the origin & destination airports.

      <p>
        We particularly noticed the role of airports in cities like NYC, LA,
        Chicago, and Atlanta as "hubs" from which other flights depart. In
        addition, most airports on the extremities of the United States are
        served primarily by only one or two airports: eg. most flights to San
        Juan in Puerto Rico are from New York.

      <h2>A per-city comparison of flight traffic and population.</h2>
      <p>
        From the above map, we noticed a significant amount of variation in the
        outbound flight traffic from any one area. To better understand the
        factors that might drive this traffic, we compared the number of
        outbound flights from the airports in a given city with that city's
        population.

      <script src="assets/scatterplot.js"></script>
      <p>
        As seen from this scatter plot, the cities with the largest populations
        tended to also have a significant amount of outbound flight traffic. Of
        particular interest, however, are Chicago, Houston, and Atlanta. All
        three cities have more flight traffic than cities of comparable size. As
        it turns out, this is likely because they operate as "hubs" through
        which major airlines conduct a large amount of their flights.
